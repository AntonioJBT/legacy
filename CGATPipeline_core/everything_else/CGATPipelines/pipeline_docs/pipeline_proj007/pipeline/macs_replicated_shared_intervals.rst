CAPSeq Liver Testes Shared Intervals
=====================================

The following table presents the number of replicated intervals in each dataset, 
which overlap with one or more intervals in all other datasets:

   Intervals shared between all datasets
   
Genomic Location
-----------------

Intervals were classified according to their overlap with these features. Classification was hierarchical, 
such that if an interval overlapped two types of feature (for example from overlapping gene models) then 
that interval was annotated with the term that is highest in the tree. The hierarchy is outlined in the table below.

+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Term           | Definition                                                                      |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|TSS            |Per Transcript: Located within 1kb of a transcriptional start site of a          |
|               |protein-coding transcript                                                        |
|               |Per Gene: the gene transcriptional start site (TSS) interval was taken as the    |
|               |region from the first TSS to the last per gene + 1kb either side                 |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Gene           |Overlapping a gene region (intron/exon/utr) but not a TSS region                 |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Upstream       |Not any of the above and within 5kb upstream of a protein-coding gene            |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Downstream     |Not any of the above and within 5kb downstream of a protein-coding gene          |
+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Intergenic     |None of the above. At least 5kb from the nearest protein coding gene             |

CpG Observed/Expected
----------------------

The following plots show the distribution of observed/expected CpGs for each set.
The expected number of CpG dinucleotides was calculated as the product of the number of C and G nucleotides 
in the interval divided by the interval length as in Emboss cpgplot.
The control dataset was generated by taking an interval of the same size 10kb upstream of the CpG island.
