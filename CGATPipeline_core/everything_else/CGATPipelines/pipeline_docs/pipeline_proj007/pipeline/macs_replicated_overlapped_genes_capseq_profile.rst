================================
Overlapped Genes CAPseq Profile
================================

Density of CAPseq reads over genes overlapped >90% by CAPseq intervals. 
Genes which are overlapped <50% by CAPseq intervals were used for comparison. 
This method counts CAPseq reads overlapping the entire gene model (exons and introns).
