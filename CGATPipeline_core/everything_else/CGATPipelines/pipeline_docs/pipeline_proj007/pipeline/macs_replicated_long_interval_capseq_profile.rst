====================================
Long Interval Genes CAPseq Profile
====================================

Density of CAPseq reads over 500 genes with a minimum 1bp overlap with long (>3kb) CAPseq intervals. 
500 genes which overlap a CAPseq interval of average length were used for comparison. 
This method counts CAPseq reads overlapping the entire gene model (exons and introns)
