Frameshifts
+++++++++++

Frameshifts are caused by short indels.

   Transcripts with an indel resulting in a frameshift.

In-frame indels
+++++++++++++++

Insertions and deletions with a length divisible by three can occur as in-frame deletions, 
adding or removing one or more amino-acids to a protein.
